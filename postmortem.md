# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## What's your name?
Omar F Roa


## How difficult was this assignment?
Getting started was challenging, but once I figured out
the grid system and keeping content in containers, things were much easier.

## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
Definitely! I learned a ton about Bootstrap and how easy it is
to mock a static website very quickly. Using Bootstrap really
made me think about the DOM model and nested elements.

## How could this assignment be improved?
I thought this was a very solid assignment, to be honest.
There was a good amount of challenge. If anything, maybe try to get us to animate
something or use a trigger to transform something? You mentioned to not use
certain code for animation, so it could reinforce the point.

## Any other comments?
I really enjoyed this assignment!  I have wanted to build a static
website but never knew what to build. This gave me an excuse to just
build SOMETHING. It exposed me to Bootstrap and Sass. Two words I've
heard but never used.
